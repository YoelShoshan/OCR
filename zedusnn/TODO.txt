*  Try alternative input/outputs
    * create one big database to allow random selection from imageS
	* try providing a bigger kenrel as input
	* provide color as well?
	* provide depth as well?

Check what should i do with the other color components - for example, use the high res UV values and see how it looks like

* Check why there are identical parts in the NN files !!!

* weight update - consider sign alone / momentum / alternative methods (hassin/newton based)
 Other weight update methods:
 - momentom
 - update speed per weight
 - consider looking at second dervivate
 - consider only the sign of the dervivate
  
 * Change the progress method - consider ALTERNATIVE METHODS - like 
* Consider moving to Matlab/Python/CUDA 

* Visualize learning curve

* Visualize Neurons weights matrix

* Visual tool to play with developed NN

Parallelism - GPU

    Different mini-batch test cases
    Inside a test case, different neurons inside a layer
